## Standalone

This version of the code will run on most arduino boards, tested mainly on a nano. I have also done a simple breakout board for an Arduino Pro Mini

## FlthyHP

Use an existing FlthyMcNasty HP board's spare pins and combine the system. 

## ReelTwo

Also available in the ReelTwo library for R2. https://github.com/reeltwo/Reeltwo
